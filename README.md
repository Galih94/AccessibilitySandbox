# AccessibilitySandbox
This is a basic learning technique project diving deep into making apps accessible in SwiftUI. It explores how to ensure your app is usable for everyone, including those who rely on accessibility features such as VoiceOver. While SwiftUI provides great accessibility support out of the box, this project focuses on enhancing it by adding custom accessibility information and testing on real devices.

The source learning is from 15th project of course "100 Days of SwiftUI" (https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)
